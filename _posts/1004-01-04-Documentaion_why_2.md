## Documentation

    * Code is _surface area_. Testing and documentation are _coverage_.
    * Untested, undocumented code _cannot be trusted_. In some sense, it is worse than having no code at all.
    * Reliable documentation is _key_ to scaling a data team.ยน
    * The generation of data documentation should be automated.
    * Data documentation should include both:
        * Inferred information from the codebase/database
        * Manual inputs ("this field means that")
